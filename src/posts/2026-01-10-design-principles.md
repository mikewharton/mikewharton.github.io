Good design is invisible—users shouldn't notice it, but they should feel it. Here are some principles I follow when designing web interfaces.

## Clarity Over Cleverness

The best interfaces are immediately understandable. Users shouldn't have to guess what something does or where to find it.

## Consistency Creates Comfort

Consistent patterns help users build mental models of your interface. Once they understand one part, they can apply that knowledge elsewhere.

## Performance is a Feature

A beautiful design means nothing if it's slow. Every millisecond counts, and users notice when things feel sluggish.

## Accessibility First

Designing for accessibility doesn't mean compromising on aesthetics. In fact, accessible design often leads to better experiences for everyone.

These principles guide my work, whether I'm designing a simple blog or a complex web application.
