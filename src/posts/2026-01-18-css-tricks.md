CSS has evolved dramatically over the years. Here are some advanced techniques that can help you build more sophisticated layouts and effects.

## CSS Grid and Flexbox

Modern layout techniques like Grid and Flexbox have revolutionized how we structure web pages. Understanding when to use each is key.

## Custom Properties (CSS Variables)

CSS custom properties enable dynamic theming and make it easier to maintain consistent design systems across large projects.

## Backdrop Filters

The `backdrop-filter` property enables glass-morphism effects that were previously difficult to achieve. It's perfect for modern, translucent UI elements.

## Container Queries

Container queries allow us to style elements based on their container size, not just the viewport. This enables more modular, component-based responsive design.

These techniques are just the beginning. CSS continues to evolve, offering new possibilities for creative web design.
