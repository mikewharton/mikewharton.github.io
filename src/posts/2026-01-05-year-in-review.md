As we start a new year, it's a good time to reflect on what we accomplished in 2025.

## Research Milestones

Several research projects reached important milestones this year. The work on robust visual navigation showed particularly promising results.

I launched several side projects, including this website redesign. The new static site approach has been working well.

## Learning and Growth

The year was filled with learning opportunities, from exploring new web technologies to diving deeper into machine learning research.

Here's to another year of progress and discovery!
