This project involved a detailed analysis of geopolitical considerations for making a long-term commitment to nuclear power.

Molten Salt Fast Reactors (MSFR) were deemed to be the best option of the Generation IV reactors:

- Higher operating temperatures, giving higher Carnot efficiency
- Near-atmospheric operating pressure
- No water usage, eliminating steam explosion risk
- Reactor contents remain liquid, preventing meltdowns

A detailed material selection and stress corrosion cracking failure analysis of a hexagonal tank wall weld from the proposed design was also carried out.
