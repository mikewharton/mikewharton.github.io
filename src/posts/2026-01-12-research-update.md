This post covers some of the recent developments in my research work, focusing on machine learning applications in robotics.

## Learning Control Systems

We've been working on adaptive control systems that can learn from experience. The results show promising improvements in task completion rates.

## Visual Navigation

Robust visual navigation remains a challenging problem. Our latest experiments demonstrate significant improvements in handling edge cases and environmental variations.

## Sim-to-Real Transfer

Bridging the gap between simulation and reality continues to be a focus area. Recent work shows that domain randomization techniques can help improve transfer performance.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine these approaches.
