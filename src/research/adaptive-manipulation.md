## Summary

This work demonstrates how tactile sensing can be integrated into manipulation policies to handle objects with varying material properties, shapes, and weights.

## Approach

We develop a hierarchical control architecture that combines high-level planning with low-level reactive control based on tactile feedback. The system learns to adapt its grip force and manipulation strategy in real-time.

## Results

- **Success Rate**: 94% for objects with unknown properties
- **Adaptation Time**: < 0.5 seconds to adjust to new object
- **Generalization**: Works across diverse object categories
