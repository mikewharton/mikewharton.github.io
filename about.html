					<p class="mt-0">Achieving 83% in my final year group project titled “Exploring and modelling the causes and effects of dynamic chain drive vibrations”, I earned the Bechtel Industrial Group Project Prize for the highest average group mark in the cohort. I worked alongside RAs in the Electrical Energy Management and Composites groups combining materials, software, and experimental analysis of resonant bike chains using slow-motion videogrammetry. In the process I learnt a lot about modelling, using my team-working and organisation skills to coordinate large-scale experiments requiring equipment from across the department.</p>
					
					<p class="fw-semibold mb-0"><span class="align-text-bottom">■</span> 2023 (June-September), Design and Manufacturing Futures Research Group</p>
					
					<p class="mt-0">Alongside postgraduate students and academics in the Design and Manufacturing Futures Research Group, I carried out a paid standalone research project over four months exploring how the use of haptics could impact prototyping of the future. The project involved academic writing, coding in Python and Unity, as well as hands-on control work with Arduino, ESP32, haptic motors, a laser vibrometer and 3D printing. I was the lead author of a conference paper for the 2024 International DESIGN conference in Croatia, learning about electronics as well as the drafting process and taking advantage of my communication skills delivering weekly updates.</p>
					
					<p class="fw-semibold mb-0"><span class="align-text-bottom">■</span> 2023 (January-April), University of Bristol</p>
					
					<p class="mt-0">I achieved 83% in my individual research project “On the Use of Photogrammetry for Low-Cost Structural Health Monitoring”, subsequently publishing this work in the Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing journal. For the project, I produced a proof-of-concept software package in MATLAB capable of rudimentary dynamic image analysis, and using a video camera with a high optical zoom I demonstrated its capability for long-range non-contact dynamic analysis on the Clifton suspension bridge. I expanded my knowledge of image processing algorithms and produced one of my own, which later led to publication, demonstrating my creativity and initiative.</p>
					
					<p class="fw-semibold mb-0"><span class="align-text-bottom">■</span> 2022-2024 Bristol Institute for Learning and Teaching (BILT) Conference</p>
					
					<p class="mt-0">Working as a paid research assistant and student ambassador alongside three senior academics in engineering and social sciences, I conducted interviews and carried out qualitative analysis of hundreds of student responses, produced an infographic poster, and delivered a solo conference presentation to ~50 attendees. During this project, I learnt about ethics and working across disciplines, and took advantage of my leadership skills by running a focus group.</p>

					<p class="mt-0">Working as a Trainee Patent Attorney in an SME alongside experienced academics in life sciences, chemistry, physics, and engineering, I have learnt the fundamentals of Intellectual Property (IP) law, and helped to draft patent applications for university academics in Bath and London, as well as larger multinational companies. I have gained a deeper understanding of the uses of IP as well as what makes a good invention in a research context.</p>

					<p class="mt-0">Interning with a small engineering team to support the design and enhancement of wireless load sensors for racing yachts, as well as working on marketing and operations management, I pioneered quality assurance methods and put my theory into practice to assess and communicate the structural integrity of components through technical drawings and presentations.</p>
