## Summary

This project explores how teams of robots can learn to coordinate their actions through distributed learning algorithms. The approach enables scalable coordination without centralized control.

## Key Contributions

- Distributed policy learning that scales to large robot teams
- Communication-efficient coordination protocols
- Robustness to individual robot failures

## Applications

- Warehouse automation
- Search and rescue operations
- Environmental monitoring
