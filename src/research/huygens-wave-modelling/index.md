Defects were characterised using wave modelling in MATLAB based on Full Matrix Capture (FMC) data from an ultrasound scan of a broken part.

An optimisation study was carried out to determine optimum parameters such as centre frequency, element pitch, width, position, number of elements, and Hanning filter size. This project involved extensive use of Fast Fourier Transforms.
