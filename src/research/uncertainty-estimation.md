## Summary

We propose methods to estimate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in deep learning policies, enabling robots to recognize when they're operating outside their training distribution.

## Key Contributions

- Novel uncertainty quantification techniques for policy networks
- Uncertainty-aware planning and control
- Failure prediction and recovery strategies

## Impact

This work enables safer deployment of learned policies by allowing robots to recognize and handle novel situations appropriately.
