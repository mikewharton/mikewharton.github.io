During the summer of 2023, I carried out a paid research internship in the Design and Manufacturing Futures (DMF) Laboratory at the University of Bristol. This began with the aim of producing a solution for integrating haptics within prototypes. Companies often spend vast amounts producing mock-ups, particularly in the latter stages of the design process. Any improvements in fidelity (how believable a model feels) or modularity (reducing wasted material when producing new iterations) are therefore highly sought after.

This creates an interesting challenge of optimising how the brain is tricked into perceiving specific kinaesthetic or cutaneous properties. Alongside learning about electronics, prototyping, and haptic motors, I explored new methods of dynamic analysis, including acoustic emission techniques.

Repositories containing my code for the Arduino-based
[touch sensor](https://github.com/DMFDML/touch-sensor)
and the
[haptics demo](https://github.com/DMFDML/haptics-demo)
—which involved a model rendered in the Unity game engine and experienced in VR, linked in real time to the actuator embedded in the prototype—can be found on the DMF Design and Manufacturing Laboratory GitHub page.

During the project, I developed an interest in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), particularly the psychology and physiology underpinning these interactions. I carried out a thorough review of existing literature, both contemporary and historical, with a focus on human sensory systems. These systems are fundamental to understanding everyday interaction and are likely to play an important role in future bio-inspired design approaches.

I was the lead author of a peer-reviewed
[conference paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/pds.2024.87)
resulting from this work, which was presented at DESIGN 2024 in Croatia.

An early blog post from the project is available on the laboratory website:
