This was a six-month research project carried out in a group of five, we went on to win the Bechtel Industrial prize for the highest mark in the cohort. It was following the work of a PhD student whose thesis can be found [here](https://hdl.handle.net/1983/c3b9b1c2-79d7-42e5-b196-5e0063b9822a). The aim was to help extract performance from bicycle chains, which our project aimed to help by seeing if it was possible to model the (resonant or other) chain dynamics accurately using a more simple analytical or numerical model. We established a ground truth model (using an existing expensive setup with large motors to spin a bike chain around at a repeatable speed/torque), and then performed experiments on simpler static experimental models, as well as a numerical Finite Element (FE) model, and an analytical model from the mid 20th century by Mahalingam. We managed to track down Mahalingam's original thesis from Sheffield using an inter-library loan which was very interesting. It turned out that the old model was incredibly accurate for predicting resonance, which was remarkable given how computationally cheap it was.

The highlight of this project for me was learning how to use high speed cameras and lighting, and using this video footage for tracking, similarly to my work on Mean Intensity Mapping (MIM). As well as known methods from my previous work such as photogrammetry and acoustic emission, we used a genetic algorithm for identifying parasitic motor frequencies. There were also a few less scientific experiments with the high speed camera involving balloons when we had some spare time.

Resulting findings from this project have since been accepted for presentation at the 21st International Conference on Experimental Mechanics under the title *“Validation of Chain Drive Resonance Models by Video, Audio and Torque Measurements”*. A journal paper is also in the works.
